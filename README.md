# PGCLIB

Original PGCBMP and PGCTALK code by John Elliott, 13 November, 2004.
Posted to github and subsequent modifications by trguhq, 2025 and on.

This is a C library to interface with the IBM PGC card and compatibles.
It is intended to be used either as a library, or just as an include file
for definitions of the commands, data types, memory locations, etc. to
facilitate direct access with your own code.

This is not in a working state at the moment and has not even been
compiled to test. Purely a development snapshot.

## Sample programs

Samples are included for development and testing purposes.
